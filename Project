# Real-Time Face Mask Detection System (Live Camera)

## Project Overview
This project implements a real-time face mask detection system using computer vision techniques.  
The system analyzes a live webcam feed to detect human faces and determines whether a person is wearing a face mask or not.

The project is designed to demonstrate real-time video processing and object detection concepts using Python and OpenCV.

## Objectives
- To detect human faces from a live camera feed
- To classify detected faces as **Mask** or **No Mask**
- To demonstrate real-time computer vision processing
- To build a practical and explainable system suitable for academic evaluation

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **OpenCV**
- **NumPy**

## How the System Works

### 1. Face Detection
- The system uses a **Haar Cascade Classifier** to detect faces in each video frame.
- Haar Cascade is a classical machine learning-based approach provided by OpenCV for object detection.
- Each detected face is enclosed inside a bounding rectangle.

### 2. Mask Detection Logic
- Once a face is detected, the system analyzes the **lower half of the face**.
- If the lower facial region appears darker (indicating a mask covering the mouth and nose), the system classifies it as **MASK**.
- Otherwise, it is classified as **NO MASK**.

### 3. Real-Time Processing
- The webcam feed is processed frame-by-frame.
- Detection and classification happen instantly, providing real-time output on screen.

## How to Run the Project
